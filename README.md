# Car-VIN-Finder-Wahooo

The program should take a licence plate number eg. ABC123, add it to url of https://thatcar.nz/c/, and then search the car page on the website e.g. https://thatcar.nz/c/ABC123.
It's doing this succesfully, but needs to specifically pull the VIN code, "7A8CJ0P0797205527" in this example. Where dya reckon im going wrong here? Ive tried xpath too and had many problems lol.
